# Python Libraries and Packages

Libraries extend the abilities of Python. Some libraries are included by default with Python and simply need to be imported. Others are third-party packages that need to be installed using `pip`. You can also create your own packages for personal use or to share with others!

## Topics Covered

- **Libraries**
- **Random**
- **Statistics**
- **Command-Line Arguments**
- **Slice**
- **Packages**
- **APIs**
- **Making Your Own Libraries**

# Regular expressions (Regex)

## Regex Patterns
### MetaCharacters
- **.   any character except a new line**
- ***   0 or more repetitions**
- **+   1 or more repetitions**
- **?   0 or 1 repetition**

### Quantifiers
- **{m} m repetitions**
- **{m,n} m-n repetitions**

### Anchors
- **^   matches the start of the string**
- **$   matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string**

### Character set and Character Classes
- **[]    set of characters**
- **[^]   complementing the set**

### PreDefined Character classes
- **\d    decimal digit**
- **\D    not a decimal digit**
- **\s    whitespace characters**
- **\S    not a whitespace character**
- **\w    word character, as well as numbers and the underscore**
- **\W    not a word character**

### Alternation
- **A|B     either A or B**

### Grouping Constructs
- **(...)   a group**
- **(?:...) non-capturing version**
